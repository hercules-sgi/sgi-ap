Bo Jin,S background  although pedicle screw placement  psp  is a well  established technique for spine surgery  the treatment of patients with primary invasive spinal tumor  pist  has high surgical risks secondary to destroyed pedicles  S S intraoperative three  dimensional fluoroscopy  based navigation  itfn  system permits safe and accurate instrumentation of the spine with the advantage of obtaining intraoperative real  time three  dimensional images and automatic registration  S S the aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of psp using itfn system for patients afflicted with pist in the thoracic spinemethodsfiftyone patients diagnosed with pists were retrospectively analyzed  and 157 pedicles screws were implanted in 23 patients using the free  hand technique  free  hand group  and 197 pedicle screws were implanted in 28 patients using the itfn system  itfn group   S S modified classification of gertzbein and robbins was used to evaluate the accuracy of psp  and mccormick classification was applied for assessment of neurological function  S S demographic data and factors affecting accuracy of screw insertion were compared using independent t  test while comparison of accuracy of screw insertion between the two groups was analyzed with chi  square testresultsof 51 patients  39 demonstrated improved neurological status and the other 12 patients reported that symptoms remained the same  in the free  hand group  145 screws  924  were grade i  9 screws  57  were grade ii  and 3 screws  19  were grade iii  in the itfn group  192 screws  974  were grade i  5 screws  26  were grade ii  and no grade iii screw was detected  S S statistical analysis showed that the accuracies of pedicle screws in the two groups are significantly different  2  4981  p  0026conclusions  the treatments of pists include total tumor resection and reconstruction of spine stability  S S the itfn system provides a high accuracy of pedicle screw placement  S,1
